Here’s a detailed written explanation of the **Kubernetes CI/CD Pipeline** image you provided, comparing the **Conventional Pipeline** with a **Kubernetes-native Pipeline** across the CI/CD stages:

---

## 🔁 Kubernetes CI/CD Pipeline Breakdown

---

### 🧑‍💻 **1. Code**

#### Shared Step (Both Pipelines):

* **Developers** write code and **commit** it to a **Git repository** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

---

### 🏗️ **2. Build & Package**

#### 🛠️ Conventional Pipeline:

* Code is built using testing and quality tools like:

  * **JUnit 5** (unit testing framework)
  * **SonarQube** (code quality scanner)
* Artifacts (e.g., JAR/WAR files) are stored in a build repository like:

  * **JFrog Artifactory**

#### 🐳 Kubernetes Pipeline:

* Code is **dockerized** (packaged into container images).
* Still uses **JUnit 5** and **SonarQube** for build and test validation.
* The Docker image is **pushed to a container registry** (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).

---

### 🚀 **3. Deploy & Test**

#### 🧪 Conventional Pipeline:

* Artifacts are deployed in stages:

  1. **Staging Environment** → for Staging Testing
  2. **QA Environment** → for QA Testing
  3. **Production Environment** → for final deployment
* Manual or scripted testing and monitoring is done at each stage.

#### ☸️ Kubernetes Pipeline:

* Kubernetes deployment is handled using **Kubernetes configuration (YAML/Helm)**.

* A **Rollout Strategy** is applied:

  * **Blue-Green** (deploy to parallel environments)
  * **Canary** (partial release to a subset of users)

* Images are deployed to:

  1. **Staging Cluster** → for testing
  2. **QA Cluster** → for testing
  3. **Prod Cluster** → for production

* Each environment is a dedicated **Kubernetes cluster** (or namespace).

* Monitoring and maintenance continue post-deployment.

| Step              | Conventional CI/CD                  | Kubernetes CI/CD                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Build Output      | App binaries or packages            | Docker images                           |
| Artifact Storage  | JFrog Artifactory                   | Container registry                      |
| Testing           | JUnit, SonarQube                    | Same tools; integrated in CI/CD tools   |
| Deployment Target | Staging/QA/Prod VMs or bare-metal   | Kubernetes Clusters                     |
| Rollout Strategy  | Linear                              | Canary, Blue-Green                      |
| Environments      | Shared or separate physical/logical | Isolated Kubernetes namespaces/clusters |
